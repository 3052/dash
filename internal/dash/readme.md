# dash

Go language, I need a package to parse DASH (MPD) files

1. standard library only
2. use a separate file for each type
3. package will be called "dash"
4. parse input will be byte slice
5. include test Go file
6. test will read from rakuten.mpd, which user will provide
7. only send new or updated files
