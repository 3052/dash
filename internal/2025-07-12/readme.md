Optimal Subset (using this greedy approximation):
The files in the optimal subset are:

- canal.mpd
- criterion.mpd
- max.mpd
- molotov.mpd
- rakuten.mpd

This set of 5 files should ensure that every state in your states slice still
has at least one example file present. It's important to remember that for
NP-hard problems, a greedy algorithm provides a good approximation, but it's
not guaranteed to be the absolute smallest possible set, though it often is for
practical cases.
